Description: This package wrangles Twitter data. 
    Twitter data collected from Steaming API in .jsonl file format can be parsed and flattened into a 2D tibble. 
    This package also enables web scaping from Twitter. This is expecially useful to collect historical data because Twitter's search API only allows to search fro tweets sent in the last 7-9 days. 
    The package is constantly under development and suggestions, pull and feature requests are encouraged. 
    Features that will be added to the package in the future are:
        * Clean tweet text
        * Derive topic models
        * Prepare RT data for social network analysis
        * Calculate RT counts
        * Calculate RT lags
        * Derive user gender based on names
        * Calculate sentiment scores
        * Text classification using externally built classifiers.
